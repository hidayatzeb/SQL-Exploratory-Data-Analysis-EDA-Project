## SQL Scripts for Exploratory Data Analysis and Business Insights
---
This project showcases a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts designed for end-to-end data exploration, business reporting, and performance analysis within a relational database. The objective was to equip data analysts and BI professionals with reusable, well-structured SQL queries that focus on real-world analytical scenarios.

### Key Highlights:
**Database Exploration:** Extracted unique values (e.g., countries, categories, products) to understand the structure and scope of the dataset.

**Descriptive Metrics:** Calculated essential business metrics such as total sales, number of items sold, average selling price, order counts, customer activity, and product variety.

**Customer & Product Insights:** Identified key customer demographics, top and bottom customers by revenue and order count, and product performance rankings.

**Time-Based & Trend Analysis:** Tracked monthly sales trends and cumulative revenue using window functions.

Conducted year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons to highlight performance shifts.

**Segmentation & Categorization:** Grouped products by cost range and revenue performance.

Segmented customers by activity and order behavior (VIP, Regular, New).

**Part-to-Whole Analysis:** Assessed each categoryâ€™s contribution to overall sales and identified top-performing regions or customer groups.

## Comprehensive Reports:



**Customer Report:** Included metrics like total orders, lifetime spend, average order value, recency, and customer categorization.

**Product Report:** Included KPIs such as total revenue, quantity sold, customer reach, product segmentation, and monthly revenue trends.

**Techniques Used:**
Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Window functions ( OVER )

Conditional logic with CASE

Time series analysis

Data segmentation and cohort analysis

Subqueries and CTEs for layered reporting

This project not only highlights best practices in writing optimized and readable SQL code but also reflects real business use cases for dashboards, KPIs, and strategic insights.
